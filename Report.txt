## üîç Phishing Indicators Found

1. **Spoofed Sender Address**  
   - Email is from `support@paypa1.com` instead of `support@paypal.com` (note the "1" instead of "l").

2. **Urgent / Threatening Language**  
   - Phrases like *"urgent"*, *"temporarily locked"*, and *"avoid permanent suspension"* pressure the user to act quickly.

3. **Suspicious Link**  
   - The link text says "Click here to verify" but the real link points to `http://secure-paypa1.com/login`, a fake domain.

4. **Grammar/Spelling**  
   - Phrasing is awkward (e.g., "Thank you for using PayPal" instead of something more formal or personalized).

5. **No Personalization**  
   - Legitimate companies usually include your name or account info, not a generic "Dear user".

6. **Fake Domain Name**  
   - The domain `secure-paypa1.com` closely mimics PayPal but is not authentic.
